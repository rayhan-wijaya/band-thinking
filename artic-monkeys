The mindset of an Alpha male, the possiblity to even turn into Patrick Bateman.

Nervy and literate.

The possibility to overdose on affection, from their "Do I Wanna Know?"

Best transation, from Do I wanna Know to R U Mine?

"Whatever People Say, THat's What I'm Not" gets me thinking of
oversatisfaction. The fact that they did so good on R U Mine leads me to think
that they overdid it, they got lost in it. There's even two explicit songs in
it. Think about explicitness for a moment here, it's not always good, or enough
to really express. If you're the other person, watching You doing the explicit,
vulgar words, would you think the spectator (the other person) would get a good
image of you?

Fluorescent Adolence has been made by very authentic thinking men, I must
admit. It shocked me to my core. This all happened because of "transition."
It's not enough if you do one song in a band performance, to really emulate
that feeling of listening to an album, you need transition. Either in the music
itself, OR even multiple songs. Transition between notes, or transition between
sections ("a single song")

Snap Out Of It, good. IT contradicts Fluorescent Adolence. But then it almost
as if, gets to the same mood as Fluorescent Adolence in the ending.

Nevermind, they made "Whatever People Say, THat's What I'm Not" in 2006, then
they got better until AM in 2013. wow, these guys Are good.
